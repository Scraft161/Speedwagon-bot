# Speedwagon-bot

ever thought another discord bot would just add to the pile of useless bots that exist.
Allow me to introduce Speedwagon bot, a bot so useless it needs to look like a gentlemen in order to appeal to others.

## configuration

You can configure the bot using a `config.json` file in the bot directory
Currently there are only two options you can set.

```json
{
  "token": "Bot token obtained from discord",
  "prefix": "Prefix used for commands"
}
```

## features

`rate` let Speedwagon give his thoughts on something.
PS: if it's Jonathan related he might not be objective about it.

`quote` get quotes from various JoJo characters or the bot developers

## copying

This bot's source code is free to be used by anyone else, it is still facing early development as of now, so bugs shall be plenty.
